# Classic ASP Language Support

Adds Syntax highlighting and snippets to ASP files in VSCode.

Originally converted from [TextMate's ASP bundle](https://github.com/textmate/asp.tmbundle)

Personally, I have lung cancer and it is last stage so I don't have much time to develop this extension.

So, *CONTRIBUTIONS* are greatly appreciated. 

Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
