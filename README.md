# Classic ASP Language Support from tmBundle (with html support)

Why Visual Studio Code doesn't support Classic ASP syntaxes basically?

This Extension is from [ilich's vscode-classic-asp](https://github.com/ilich/vscode-classic-asp)

But it doesn't include html support, so I wrote new extension originated from [Textmate's ASP bundle](https://github.com/textmate/asp.tmbundle).


## Features

It supports just only ASP and HTML syntaxes yet.

## Requirements

Visual Studio Code 1.5.0 or higher

## Known Issues

Let me know if you having trouble with using this extension.
